### Description of my Portfolio Website

I built a portfolio website using HTML and CSS to showcase myself as a web developer to future employers and collaborators. Using four main HTML pages, five pages for blog posts, and a CSS stylesheet, I was able to effectively convey my personality, skills, design tastes, tech stack and relevant experience to my target audience. By continuously pushing to Github my work in progress was secure. My portfolio is accessible to all by taking steps to ensure it meets the needs of a wide range of users with different systems and bodies. By launching to Netlify using sha-512, sha-384 and sha-256 hash keys my site maintains Sub Resource Integrity. The portfolio is registered with the Google search console using verified XML.

### Purpose

During the design phase I identified my purpose as making myself appeal to future employers and collaborators, while ensuring compliance with the rubric as established by my educators. This focus on purpose throughout the project ensured all text and graphical components were on theme, relevant, responsive and addressed specifically to my target audience. 

### Functionality / Features


**More information and screenshots of graphical and text components are contained in slides 31-39 in ppt/**


**Colour coding:** Throughout the site I divided my interests and experience into three categories and gave each an appropriate colour. This consistent theme helped the user to find information relevant to them, while displaying the areas I care about prominently. Using the theme throughout the site resulted in extra content not required by the rubric but that should showcase my abilities, personality and experience to my target audience. 


**Navigation: ** A consistent navigation utilising a drop down hamburger menu was deployed. It is styled minimally and designed mobile first and to be accessible. The text inside is targeted directly at the target audience. In the future I may make a more complicated menu utilising transition effects.


**Flexbox Card system:** The card system is my key feature, and it employs the colour coding system to maximum effect. By listing all of my work and education history in a way that ensures clear understanding and usability, I thoroughly demonstrate my true value to future employers and collaborators.


**Lists:** Lists were used for an Executive Summary on the About Page to give the user a quick takeaway of key experiences, and on the Contact page to be succinct and to the point about how they may get in touch with me.


**Social Logos:** On the contact page I have included images of the logos for Github and Codepen which link to my profiles on each. LinkedIn and social media logos and links were considered, but not included at this time as I have deleted my accounts on all social media and do not intend to have such accounts again, even professionally. My personal philosophy is that my in person networking and my ability to network online by demonstrating my coding proficiency better represent my values.


**Pages/Headings/Subheadings/Paragraphs/Lists/Spans etc all aimed at target audience:** To describe several features at once, all content written for the site has been made with the target audience in mind. For example, a page that might be named "About" or "Resume" is instead named "How I Can Help You".


#### Accessibility: 


**Perceivable**: Black and white for majority. Header Navigation could be improved. 


**Operable:** Hover functions avoidable. Menu operates on all devices with a click. Could be made keyboard selectable. 


**Understandable:** Pages are named after their function, text is in clear sentences and sections are also colour coded but it is not necessary to see colour. 


**Robust:** Mobile first approach and Dev tool preview shows functionality across full range of devices. Captions and Alt text included.


### Sitemap


Four main HTML pages are connected by consistent navigation. A resume is available for download from the About page. Five blog pages are linked via “Read More” from Projects. The site is designed as a sales funnel towards the Contact page where there are links to accounts on Github and Codepen.
